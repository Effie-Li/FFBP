    "Like everything in TensorFlow, a <b>queue</b> is a node in a TensorFlow graph. It's a stateful node, like a variable: other nodes can modify its content. In particular, nodes can enqueue new items in to the queue, or dequeue existing items from the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queues, such as <code>tf.FIFOQueue</code> and <code>tf.RandomShuffleQueue</code>, are important TensorFlow objects for computing tensors asynchronously in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a typical input architecture is to use a <code>RandomShuffleQueue</code> to prepare inputs for training a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Multiple threads prepare training examples and push them in the queue.</li>\n",
    "    <li>A training thread executes a training op that dequeues mini-batches from the queue</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "Below, we first create a FIFO queue object, setting its size and format. <code>q</code> is a graph node, but conceptually it is a variable that is subject to changes by other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such node is the next one we create. <code>q.enqueue_many</code> is a node that enqueues its input arguments into the  <code>q</code> queue. Next we create another node that is going to take one value off the queue (in a FIFO order). Variable <code>y</code> will then be assigned whatever value was dequeued plus 1. Finally we create another node that will enqueue this <code>y</code> value back into the queue.\n"
