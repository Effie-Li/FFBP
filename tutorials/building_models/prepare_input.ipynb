    "# Preparing data\n",
    "Since the [FFBP package](https://github.com/alex-ten/pdpyflow/tree/master/FFBP) runs [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), input data must be made readable for the underlying computational graph. FFBP has a special class called `InputData` that lets you easily convert a csv data file into a structure that can be injected into a Tensorflow graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The csv file must be structured in a certain way (see example below). The very first row is reserved for column labels; it is there for convenience and in effect will be ignored by InputData initialization. Each subsequent row contains a labeled input pattern. Each row is organized into a sequence of entries, whereby the first entry contains the pattern label, and the following entries encode the actual input/target data. A sequence of input data comes first, followed by a sequence of target data. The example below is from the training data file for the example auto-encoder network (spaces are added for readability):\n",

    "## `InputData` class\n",
    "It is straightforward to create an `InputData` instance from a well-organized data file. You need to specify a few parameters to make it work:\n",
    "- **`num_epochs`** : the number of epochs you are planning to train/test the model for. An epoch is a single iteration inside which a network processes the entire data set (typically seeing each pattern exactly once).\n",
    "- **`batch_size`** : the size of a subset (mini-batch) of the data set. Together with `data_len`, this parameter determines the number of weight updates per epoch of training. Specifically, within a single epoch of training, weights will be updated `data_len / batch_size` times. For example, if `batch_size == data_len`, the network will accumulate gradients for each training pattern and perform a weight update once per epoch. In contrast, if `batch_size == 1`, each training pattern will cause a weight update, making the order of training examples consequential. Moreover, if `(batch_size > 1 & batch_size < data_len)`, several training patterns will cause a weight update and there will be more than one update per epoch. Thus, `batch_size` must divide `data_len`, that is, the remainder of `data_len / batch_size` must be zero.\n",
    "- **`data_len`** : the number of input patterns in the data set. Together with `batch_size`, this parameter determines the number of weight updates per epoch of training (see `batch_size`).\n",
    "- **`inp_size`** : the number of input data points (same as the size of input layer). You can pass a list or a tuple of integers if you have multiple input placeholders. Note that the order of input sizes must correspond to the order of input placeholders when an `FFBP.Model` class is instantiated with multiple input placeholders (see tutorials on [connecting layers](https://github.com/alex-ten/pdpyflow/blob/master/tutorials/building_models/build_model.ipynb) and [training a model](https://github.com/alex-ten/pdpyflow/blob/master/tutorials/building_models/train_model.ipynb)). For example `inp_size = (2,6)` will devide the row of 8 input items into two sub-rows of sizes 2 and 6.\n",
    "- **`targ_size`** : the number of target data points (same as the size of output layer).\n",
    "-  **`shuffle_seed`** : (*default*=`None`) the seed for a random number generator that dictates the pseudorandom shuffling of input patterns. If `None`, input patterns will be fed in the same order (top to bottom, unshuffled) as they appear in the csv file. If negative (e.g. `shuffle_seed = -1`), the shuffling of examples will be irreproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: [Enqueueing](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/io_ops/queues) data for training and testing\n",
    "In the example below, we set up training and testing data for a training loop simulation. **Note** that for testing, `batch_size == 1` since we want to compute gradient information individually for each training example. Also note that we don't want to shuffle testing patterns (so ommit the `shuffle_seed` parameter or set it to `None`).\n",
